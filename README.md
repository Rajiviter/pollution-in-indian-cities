Project Title: Analyzing Pollution Levels and Pollutants in Cities
Project Overview:
This project analyzes air quality data to identify and compare pollution levels across cities, focusing on the top 100 most polluted and lowest 100 polluted cities. The goal is to understand pollutant distribution, geographical patterns, and state-wise pollution levels.

Objectives:
Identify Polluted Cities:

Determine the top 100 most polluted cities based on average pollution levels and the lowest 100 cities with the least pollution.
Analyze Pollutant Distribution:

Examine which pollutants are most common in the top 100 cities and visualize their distribution.
Geographical Insights:

Explore relationships between latitude, longitude, and pollution levels.
Visualize the distribution of polluted cities across different states, focusing on the top 5 and lowest 5 states.
Methodology:
Data Preparation:

Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and computing average pollution levels for each city.
Statistical Analysis:

Calculate correlations between pollution levels and geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).
Visualization:

Use pie charts to show the share of pollutants in the top 100 cities.
Create scatter plots to examine relationships between geographical coordinates and pollution levels.
Plot state-wise pollution data to visualize the distribution of polluted cities.
Geographical Mapping:

Utilize mapping techniques to highlight the top and lowest polluted states.
Tools and Libraries:
Python Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Data Sources: Air quality data with city, state, latitude, longitude, and pollution levels.
Key Findings:
Pollutant Prevalence: Identified the most common pollutants in the top 100 polluted cities.
Geographical Patterns: Revealed correlations between latitude, longitude, and pollution levels.
State-wise Analysis: Highlighted the top 5 states with the highest and the lowest number of polluted cities.
Conclusion:
This project offers insights into pollution patterns, pollutant distribution, and geographical variations, providing a comprehensive view of air quality issues across different regions.
